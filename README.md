I am delighted to introduce you to our business management system (ERP) specially designed for hotels. Our software offers a complete and customizable solution to help manage and optimize all your hotel operations. This ERP system has a user security system that limits the access of workers based on their permissions and roles. Depending on the job they perform, users can access certain areas and resources, while others will be restricted.
